> Estart sat around in one form or another for a couple years now. I kept
> it synchornized on my USB stick that I carried back and forth from work
> and home. It's essentially my way of setting up development and build
> environments and launching them.
>
> It improves little bits at a time, usually when I have time to work on,
> it like this last set of holidays. It works for me so I decided to
> remove my own personal bits from it, make it generic and publish it on
> github.
